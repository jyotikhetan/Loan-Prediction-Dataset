# Data Analysis and Prediction using the Loan Prediction Dataset
Loan Prediction Practice Problem
Loan Prediction dataset consists of various attributes like gender, marital status, number of dependents, education, applicant income, co-applicant income, etc. 
The goal is to predict whether the loan will be approved for a person or not. 
In this project, we would first perform dataset exploration both for numeric and categorical fields. 
Further, we would smartly handle missing values and extreme values. 
Finaly, we would build a predictive model using Python.
Also found the accuracy level of prediction.
